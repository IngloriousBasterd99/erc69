# NOTICE

This repository is the home of the ERC69 standard, including both ERC69_721 and ERC69_1155 variations. The ERC69 standard is a novel approach to token standards on Ethereum, offering unique mechanisms for wrapping and unwrapping ERC20 tokens into ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens.

# ERC69 Standard

The ERC69 standard introduces two distinct contracts, ERC69_721 and ERC69_1155, each tailored to provide innovative functionalities within their respective token categories. This standard is designed to enhance the flexibility and utility of digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain by enabling seamless conversion between different token types.

## ERC69_721

ERC69_721 is an extension of the ERC721 standard, incorporating a mechanism to wrap ERC20 tokens into ERC721 NFTs. This allows for unique asset management and liquidity options, facilitating new forms of token interactions while ensuring compatibility with the vast ecosystem of ERC721.

### Features

- Wrapping ERC20 tokens into ERC721 NFTs for innovative asset management.
- Timed unwrap functions to ensure secure and predictable asset conversion.
- Dynamic supply management to accommodate a wide range of use cases.

## ERC69_1155

ERC69_1155 expands upon the ERC1155 standard, providing a unified framework for managing both fungible and non-fungible tokens. It introduces a novel approach to wrapping ERC20 tokens into ERC1155 tokens, broadening the possibilities for asset liquidity and interaction.

### Features

- Unified management of fungible and non-fungible tokens through ERC1155's versatile standard.
- Conversion of ERC20 tokens into ERC1155 tokens, enhancing token utility and interaction.
- Secure and efficient token wrapping/unwrapping mechanisms to support diverse applications.
